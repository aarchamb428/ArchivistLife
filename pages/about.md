## About the Collection

Welcome to our family's tour of Ireland! In June of 2024, we had a lovely visit to the Emerald Isle.  This collection highlights some of the amazing history, scenery and culture of our trip.  We started in Dublin and worked our way to the southeastern side of the country, stopping in Galway first and then traversing back across the island to Waterford.  We made a complete loop and ended the tour back in Dublin.  We hope this inspires you to take your own trip of Ireland!
